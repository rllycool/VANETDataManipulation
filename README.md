*In information theory, the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. (See sample output)*

* In this short excersice, read in a file "vanetp1data.txt" containing multiple columns of data. 

* Parse the file and run various calculations.
From the data read in, calculate and sort the cars with equivalent hamming distances.
